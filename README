OpenPixi - Open Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulator.
Copyright (C) 2012  OpenPixi.org

OpenPixi is an open Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulator. It simulates the
motion of a large number of charged particles in an electro-magnetic
background. Currently the simulation supports tracking thousands of
particles in constant electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields.
Support for dynamic relativistic particles and fields is in preparation.

OpenPixi is being developed in Java, with an educational aspect in mind.
As such, it is possible to interact with the plasma in a live Java
applet. Please try out the live version at
